Additionally, more women are stepping outside these roles compared to men. This is partly due to the advantages men have in sticking to traditional roles. Education, modernization, and technology have empowered many women to break out of these roles. For a healthy marriage, it's important for both men and women to adopt positive traits from in and outside the box to benefit themselves, their children, and those around them.  \n* What practices will you adapt to help you move from inside the gender box to outside the gender box as you try to become a better spouse and parent?",
